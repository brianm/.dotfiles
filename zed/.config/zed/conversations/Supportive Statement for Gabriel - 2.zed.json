{"id":"1ce0d4b4-e6d8-4554-9f1f-de13a4ed0948","zed":"context","version":"0.4.0","text":"\n\n\nis this statement actually supportive of Gabriel?\nSure, please provide the statement you are referring to, and I can help determine if it is supportive of Gabriel.\nI worked with Gabriel on a permissions strategy in H2 2024. The goal of the work was to coach Gabriel through crafting and selling a viable approach to change the trajectory of the permissions team strategy. Gabriel had a strong voice in this, and could well describe attributes to seek. He demonstrated a good ability to work within existing constraints and make incremental improvement, but did not demonstrate vision or fluency in determining what constraints to change or how to evolve strategy rather than tactics/execution. I'd describe this as high IC5 behavior, maybe into IC6, but with quite a bit of coaching to achieve it. He was ell able to evaluate ideas from myself, Zhongqi, and Leo -- and recognized things that could drive a change, but needed to be shown how to actually get buy-in and drive the change. To be fair, the problem is probably around IC7 scope given the complexity and need for change in direction, so it was a really big ask, and that he achieved marginal success rather than crashed out on it, is a good outcome.\n\nThe statement provides a mixed assessment of Gabriel's performance. Here are the supportive and critical elements:\n\n**Supportive Elements:**\n1. Gabriel had a strong voice in the permissions strategy and could describe attributes to seek.\n2. He demonstrated a good ability to work within existing constraints and make incremental improvements.\n3. He was able to evaluate ideas from others and recognize things that could drive change.\n4. The statement acknowledges that the task was complex and that achieving marginal success rather than failing completely is a good outcome.\n\n**Critical Elements:**\n1. Gabriel did not demonstrate vision or fluency in determining what constraints to change or how to evolve strategy rather than tactics/execution.\n2. The statement suggests that Gabriel's behavior was at a high IC5 level, maybe into IC6, but required quite a bit of coaching to achieve it.\n3. He needed to be shown how to actually get buy-in and drive change.\n\nOverall, while the statement acknowledges Gabriel's strengths and the challenging nature of the task, it also highlights areas where he fell short and needed significant coaching. It is somewhat supportive but also points out specific areas for improvement.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":51}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":12},"start":53,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":52}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":13},"start":167,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":53}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":43},"start":1214,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":54}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":44},"start":2434,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":55}}}],"summary":"Supportive Statement for Gabriel","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
